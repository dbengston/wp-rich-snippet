# wp-rich-snippet
A WordPress plugin for adding structured data (rich snippets) to pages in JSON-LD format (preferred by Google) to help with SEO, especially Local SEO.

A work in progress. Currently studying up on Schema.org and Google's preferred formatting, plus building plugin code to create the JSON-LD.
